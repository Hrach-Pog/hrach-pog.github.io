    <h1>ZARA ARMENIA</h1>
    <p>
      Bringing attractive and responsible fashion, and improve the quality of customer service, are Zara's priorities
    </p>
    <p>
      Zara’s story begins with the opening of our first store in the Spanish coastal city of A Coruña in 1975, an early milestone in our company’s long history. Over the years, Zara has remained faithful to its core values, expressed simply in the same four key words that define all our stores: beauty, clarity, functionality and sustainability.

    <h1>OUR STORY</h1>
    <p>
      Zara’s story begins with the opening of our first store in the Spanish coastal city of A Coruña in 1975, an early milestone in our company’s long history. Over the years, Zara has remained faithful to its core values, expressed simply in the same four key words that define all our stores: beauty, clarity, functionality and sustainability.
    </p>
    <p>In only a few years he's executed that plan and today
      you can enjoy  just about anywhere. And, of course, the big news this year
      is that Zara teamed up with Head First readers to create Zara Web presence,
      which is growing rapidly and helping to meet the caffeine needs of a whole new set of
      customers.
    </p>
    <h1>SHOPPING IN ARMENIA</h1>

      Further enhancing the quality of our customer service, Zara stores also include Radio Frequency Identification Technology.
